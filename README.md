### Data
We obtained our unlabeled [raw data](https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc993940/) from University of North Texas which contains all "harvey" related tweets during the hurricane. Then we manually labeled them into Fake and True. Due to the limitation of our dataset, we used a pre-trained GLoVE embedding matrix from [Stanford University](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).
